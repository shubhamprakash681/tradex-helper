# TradeX – Real-Time Paper Trading Platform

## Project Description

TradeX is a production-inspired full-stack paper trading platform built using **Java (Spring Boot)** and **React**. It is designed as a showcase application that mimics the user experience of modern investment platforms such as Groww and INDmoney without executing any real financial transactions.

The application allows users to register, manage a virtual portfolio, buy and sell stocks using virtual currency, create watchlists, and visualize live market data through interactive charts. It integrates with third-party market data APIs for selected real instruments (such as NIFTYBEES) while also generating synthetic market data (for example, **SNIFTYBEES**) using Kafka-based event streaming. This demonstrates both external data integration and event-driven architecture.

The project is intended to follow production-grade software engineering practices, including modular architecture, RESTful APIs, JWT authentication, WebSockets, Redis caching, Kafka messaging, Docker-based deployment, automated testing, and observability.

## Project Objectives

- Build a scalable fintech-style web application.
- Demonstrate microservice-ready architecture using Spring Boot.
- Implement secure authentication and authorization.

- Stream real-time market prices using Kafka and WebSockets.

# Implementation Status

## Completed: Milestone 1 – Foundation

This repository is now scaffolded as a Maven multi-module Spring Boot microservice system:

- `common-lib` – shared JWT utilities, JWT properties, principal model, and API error shape.
- `config-server` – centralized Spring Cloud Config Server running on port `8888`, backed by `config-server/src/main/resources/config-repo`.
- `discovery-server` – Eureka service registry running on port `8761`.
- `api-gateway` – Spring Cloud Gateway running on port `8080`, with Java-based routes and a Java `GlobalFilter` that validates JWTs before forwarding protected `/api/**` traffic.
- `auth-service` – authentication and user profile service running on port `8081`.
- `market-service` – stock catalog/search service running on port `8082`.

## Completed: Milestone 2 – Paper Trading

- `portfolio-service` – virtual portfolio, holdings, paper buy/sell orders, and transaction ledger service running on port `8083`.
- Users receive a virtual cash account on first portfolio access.
- Buy and sell orders are executed immediately using the current `market-service` stock `referencePrice`.
- Holdings track quantity, average price, market value, and unrealized P/L.
- Order history and transaction history are stored per authenticated user.

## Completed: Milestone 3 – Real-Time Streaming

- `price-stream-service` – synthetic price generation, Kafka event streaming, Redis latest-price caching, WebSocket broadcasting, and price history service running on port `8084`.
- Synthetic price ticks are generated for the seeded stock catalog and published to Kafka topic `tradex.market.prices`.
- Consumed price events are cached in Redis, persisted in PostgreSQL, and broadcast over STOMP WebSocket topics.
- WebSocket endpoint: `ws://localhost:8080/ws`.
- Broadcast topics: `/topic/market` for all ticks and `/topic/{symbol}` for individual stock ticks.

## Completed: Milestone 4 – External Market Integration

- `market-service` exposes market indices, gainers, losers, and trending APIs.
- A configurable third-party provider can be enabled with `TRADEX_EXTERNAL_MARKET_*` settings.
- Local fallback market data keeps the APIs usable without external API credentials.
- Market responses are normalized and published to Kafka topic `tradex.market.prices` for the real-time stream.

## Completed: Milestone 5 – Advanced Product Features

- `notification-service` – watchlists, price alerts, notification history, Redis watchlist caching, and Kafka-based alert triggers running on port `8085`.
- Watchlists are cached per user in Redis and invalidated on add/remove.
- Price alerts subscribe to Kafka price ticks and create user notifications when targets are crossed.
- Notification history is persisted per authenticated user.

## Local Run Commands

Start PostgreSQL, Redis, and Kafka first. The Spring services read database, Redis, Kafka, and JWT settings from the Config Server, which resolves them from `.env`.

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres_container pgadmin_container redis_container kafka_container
```

Use the same `TRADEX_JWT_SECRET` value for all services. For local runs, `POSTGRES_HOST=localhost` and `POSTGRES_PORT=5431` match the Compose port mapping.

```bash
set -a
source .env
set +a
mvn -pl config-server spring-boot:run
mvn -pl discovery-server spring-boot:run
mvn -pl auth-service spring-boot:run
mvn -pl market-service spring-boot:run
mvn -pl portfolio-service spring-boot:run
mvn -pl price-stream-service spring-boot:run
mvn -pl notification-service spring-boot:run
mvn -pl api-gateway spring-boot:run
```

Run the full build:

```bash
mvn test
```
